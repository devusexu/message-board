# message-board
a message board without using framework
## goal
to build a message board where authorized users can post, view, edit, delete messages
## tasks
1. unauthorized users can see nothing
2. authorized users can create, view, edit, delete messages, where edit/delete can only be done by the message's author
3. no separate message page. Edit and delete should happen right on the board so the author can see the context when editing/deleting message. In this case, it should look like there is only one single page (besides register/login page)
## timeline
Phase 1 (3 days): messages' CRUD  
Phase 2 (2 days): authentication 
## future works
1. messages update in real-time(with websocket) so it feels like a chat-room
2. users can see who is typing
3. users can create other named boards
## concepts to practice
- MVC
- session authentication 
- CRUD
- OOP
- git, especially conventional commit
- .etc
