a message board without using framework

## concepts to practice
- MVC
- session authentication 
- CRUD
- OOP
- git, especially conventional commit
- .etc

## project goal
To build a message board where authorized users can discuss in real-time

1. unauthorized users cannot see anything 
2. authorized users can create, edit, delete their message, and see others' messages
3. There should be no single message page, like message?id=5, which means the edit and delete page should happen in the same page as the whole board
4. 
## project roadmap
